<h3>TSA Events</h3>

<p>TSA offers a variety of competitive events in a wide range of technical fields.  The events are described below in three groups - <i>regional events</i>, which are available at the Regional, State, and National Conferences; <i>state events</i>, which are available at the State and National Conferences; and <i>Virginia events</i>, which are only available at the Virginia State Conference (Technosphere).</p>

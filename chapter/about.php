<p>TJ TSA is currently finishing preparations for Virginia Technosphere 2015 where it hopes to make it a hat-trick and win the <i>Arvid W. Van Dyke Outstanding School Award</i> for the third straight year!</p>

<p>This year for J-day (our school's annual end-of-year celebration) TJ TSA will be hosting a game room in Mr. Piccione's room (146). We plan on having four different set ups of either the Wii or Wii U playing Super Smash Bros. and Mario Kart. We will fundraise by charging students based on time spent in the game room, charging 50&cent; for soda, and having several video game tournaments with seperate entry fees. There will be prizes for winners of the tournaments. Our fundraising goal for this event is about $400.</p>

<p>This school year the TJ TSA Chapter has 38 active members that cover all grade levels. The founding core members are all Seniors and will graduate in June of 2015 so the focus of the club has become the underclassmen. The officer core is making sure underclassmen are active participants in competitions. We have been teaching freshmen and sophomores how to build various projects and what is important for them to know in order to become technologically savvy.</p>

<p>This winter brought the most snow since TJ TSA was founded! This led to 11 snowdays and even more delays, including the Northern Regional Fair which got pushed back by two weeks. This new date caused a lot of conflicts amongst members but by coordinating project drop-offs and rides, we had a large presence and won 10 trophies!</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<h4>2013-2014</h4>

<p>When the TSA season began again in fall 2013, the chapter had gained much popularity and had established itself as a highly competitive club. Unlike the previous year, a strict applications process was used to determine members, and about 30% of applicants were rejected, producing a competing team of about 34 students. The chapter also had a different sponsor and meeting location than the previous year.</p>

<p>TJ TSA delivered once again at the 2014 Northern Regional Fair, bringing home 18 trophies and 13 additional finalist finishes totalling 31 top 10 event finishes, notably including a first-second-third sweep in Debating Technological Issues.</p>

<p>Outdoing their regional performance and gaining experience competing at the state level, TJ TSA went to Technosphere 2014 and won 19 trophies and 18 additional finalist awards to end up with 37 top 10 results. For the second consecutive year, the chapter won the <i>Arvid W. Van Dyke Outstanding School Award</i>.</p>

<p>In between Technosphere and the state tournament, TJ TSA participated in J-Day or Jefferson Day. This is TJHSST's annual field-day like event where school clubs have booths and are allowed to sell food and other items to raise funds. In addition, the Student Government sets up several moon-bounces and waterslides and there are several game rooms. TJ TSA raised over $200 selling fried oreos, donuts, twinkies, and other sweet treats.</p>

<p>This year TJ TSA had a much greater presence at the 2014 National TSA Conference because it was in our backyard in Washington D.C. We improved greatly from last year, taking home 4 trophies (2 first place) and 4 additional finalist awards for a total of 8 top 10 finishes.</p>

<h4>2012-2013</h4>

<p>The current TJHSST TSA Chapter was founded in 2012 by Lucas Lin and Kyle Herndon. Danial Hussain and Matthew Savage aided in establishing the chapter and making sure members were ready for the regional, state, and national conferences. The chapter was mostly filled with members who were graduates from the Rachel Carson Middle School TSA Chapter. That year, the chapter had 25 members.</p>

<p>The chapter's first tests of its ability came in 2013 with the Northern Regional Fair and Technosphere. TJ TSA took home 13 each at the Regional Fair and at Technosphere. TJ's Rohan Pandit won <i>Most Competitive Technosphere Participant</i>, and the school as a whole won the <i>Arvid W. Van Dyke Outstanding School Award</i>.</p>

<p>Seven of TJ TSA's members made the trip to Orlando for the National Conference in June 2013. The team had a handful of finalist finishes and a single trophy, won by Matthew Barbano for Future Technology Teacher.</p>

<h4>Pre-2012</h4>

<p>TJ had some attempts to begin TSA chapters in the past. However, most of them only lasted a single year before disbanding.</p>

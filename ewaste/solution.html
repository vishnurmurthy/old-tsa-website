			<h3>There's no better way than to use less electronics, period.</h3>
			<p class="no-indent">
				The best way to prevent e-waste build-up is to simply buy less of it. Not only do you
				reduce your carbon footprint, but by purchasing less electronics, you push producers of
				electronics to create less. This means less pollution to the environment, in more ways than one.

			<h3>Don't make waste of reusable electronics!</h3>
			<p class="no-indent">
				Instead of throwing your electronics away, consider putting it to a different use. Perhaps
				your desktop can be repurposed into a server, or maybe your television can double as a computer
				monitor. If it ain't broke, don't throw it away!
			</p>
			<h3>E-cycling Programs</h3>
			<p class="no-indent">
				There are countless nonprofits that are more than willing to take your "waste!" One such
				nonprofit is <a href="http://www.rebootforyouth.org" target="_blank">Reboot for Youth</a>,
				a 501(c)3 organization founded by TJ students dedicated to e-cycling. Reboot for Youth empowers
				children in need with the computers you donate!

			<h3>Don't have a computer or accessory to donate?</h3>

				If you live locally in Fairfax County, you're in luck! Fairfax County also runs an
				<a href="http://www.fairfaxcounty.gov/dpwes/recycling/electric-sunday.htm" target="_blank">
					e-cycling program</a>, and you can e-cycle any household electronics for free. They are
				all week long, and are the perfect solution for residents in the County.

			<h3>And if there's no other way...</h3>
			<p class="no-indent">
				Last but not least, recycling your old electronics can still be beneficial to the environment.
				Although recycling evidently creates pollution, it remains better than sending your
				electronics off to a landfill, where all of it is turned into e-waste. When you recycle electronics,
				they do not get melted down into liquid metals as you might expect. Instead, they get stripped
				of their reusable components, so that only the unusable parts become waste.

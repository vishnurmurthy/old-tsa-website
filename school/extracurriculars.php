<p>TJHSST has an 8-period schedule unlike other high schools. The "eighth period" is used for extracurricular activities. Through the use of Intranet (a website designed just for TJHSST students), students can sign up for whatever 8th period activity they want. On Mondays (called "Anchor Days" due to backpack weight) each class is 40 minutes long, so there is one block of eighth period. On Wednesdays and Fridays ("Red Days"), TJHSST has periods 5, 6, 7, and 8 for 90 minutes each. 8th period gets divided into 2 blocks, 8A and 8B. This means that on a regular week, students get five 40-minute eighth period blocks.</p> 

<p>Some clubs meet once or more a week during a specific block or blocks, while some meet less frequently. Clubs are student-run with club officers (president, vice president, captains, treasurers, etc.) and one or two teacher sponsors that supervise club activity and aid the officers whenever necessary. TJHSST has over 200 clubs that range from raising money for charities, to honor societies, to academic tutoring groups, literary groups, intramural sports activities, culture clubs, and science- and technology-related clubs.</p>

<p>TJHSST has outreach programs that come in many varieties. There are clubs such as Relay for Life that directly donate to charities, or clubs like Nothing but Nets that sends over tools (in this case musquito nets) to groups in need. TJHSST also has many clubs that focus on tutoring younger kids in nearby elementary and middle schools. Here we will highlight science and technology related outreach clubs.</p>

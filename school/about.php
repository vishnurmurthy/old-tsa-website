<p>Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology was first founded as Thomas Jefferson High School in Alexandria, VA in 1964 and was then officially made a selective VA Public Governer's school in 1985. <a href="http://tjhsst.edu" target="_blank">TJHSST</a> is part of Fairfax County Public Schools (<a href="http://www.fcps.edu" target="_blank">FCPS</a>). The school is public, but a special admissions process was created that involves a standardized test, teacher recommendations, and past achievements. The TJHSST admissions process is tweaked each year to adapt to the changing educational environment. The current principle is Dr. Evan Glazer, who earned a B.S in Mathematics, a M.S. in Mathematics Education, and a Ph.D. in Instructoral Technology (Alumni of University of Illinois and University of Georgia). A full staff directory can be found <a href="http://www.tjhsst.edu/staff_directory.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

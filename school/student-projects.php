    <li><b>Echo Steganography</b> by Corwin de Boor (Microelectronics) <a href="http://echo.strikeskids.com/blog" target="_blank">[link]</a> - This project is concerned with a method of data hiding in audio that is undetectable both to the human ear and to a standard Fourier transform.</li>

    <li><b>Arbitrary-Constellation Quadrature Amplitude Modulation</b> by Matthew Savage (Microelectronics) <a href="http://seniortech.bluepichu.com" target="_blank">[link]</a> - This project builds off of the standard encoding method used by Wifi, Bluetooth, and 4G to function with arbitrary data mappings, potentially allowing for optimizations beyond the current industry standard.</li>

    <li><b>Developing an Autonomous Underwater Microglider Prototype</b> by Danial Hussain (Oceanography) - Autonomous underwater gliders represent a new technology with the potential to revolutionize the methods with which scientists collect ocean data. Underwater gliders have a large cost-reduction potential compared to traditional methods of ocean sampling such as using research vessels which can cost thousands of dollars to operate for a single day. The hybrid microglider utilizes two buoyancy engines to change pitch and control roll.  The glider is equipped with a camera, and sonar sensor capable of mapping the seafloor.  The microglider also is equipped with a motor, so the craft can escape from strong currents or maintain a level depth while using the sonar sensor.</li>

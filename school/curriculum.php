<p>TJHSST has a unique curriculum that affords students many opportunities to pursue different avenues in scietific and technological reserarch and inquiry.  The majority of Thomas Jefferson's courses, including all of the science and technology courses, are tought at either an honors, Advanced Placement (AP), or post-AP level.  In addition to the Virginia Governer's Diploma requirements, all TJ students are required to have taken either AB or BC Calculus and one year-long Computer Science class to graduate.  There are two other main programs that TJ requires, the freshman-year IBET (Integrated Biology, English, and Technology) program and the Senior Technical Research Laboratory program.</p>

<h3>Integrated Biology, English, and Technology (IBET)</h3>

<p>IBET is a teamed program that teaches freshmen the importance of scientific writing in order to convey the details of experimentation results and technological innovations. The students learn in the same group of students for three consecutive block periods moving between the three classrooms.</p>

<p>In Design and Technology, freshmen learn the basic skills of electronics (breadboarding simple LED and resistor network circuits and measuring voltage with an ohmeter), use a Picaxe Microcontroller to build robots such as "hill climbers" and "maze solvers" in order to win in class competitions, and learn about GPS and GIS systems. Biology honors covers topics ranging from photosynthesis to the human endocrine system, to population growth factors and genetics. English 9 honors is a balance between traditional literary analysis of classic works such as <i>The Odyssey</i> and the development of scientific writing skills such as using primary source documents and interpreting scholarly articles.</p>

<p>The program's focal point is the IBET Project, a year-long group research and experimentation project in which students work in small (3-4 student) groups to research and perform an experiment on a macro- or micro-invertebrate (such as investigating the effects of caffine on planaria).</p>

<h3>Computer Science</h3>

<p>One of the graduation requirements at TJ is to take at least one year of computer science. Most students take either the Foundations of Computer Science course or the Accelerated Computer Science course, both of which serve as an introduction to programming and algorithms in Java (or, in some classes, Python). Some students fulfill the requirement through AP Computer Science, which takes a more in-depth look at algorithms and data structures in Java. After completing AP Computer Science, students may take four other computer science courses in the Computer Systems Research Lab; Artificial Intelligence 1 and 2 and Parallel Computing 1 and 2.</p>

<p>More Information on the computer science courses can be found at the <a class="nonblock" href="http://academics.tjhsst.edu/compsci/index.html">TJ Computer Science homepage</a>.</p>

<h3>Other Technology Courses</h3>

<p>Most of the Senior Technical Research Labs (explained in detail below) offer other technology courses that often serve as prerequisites. These courses are taken in their associated labs with the equipment used in those labs, giving students a feel for what the actual lab would be like should they choose it senior year.</p>

<p>These courses are:</p>

<ul class="arrow-bullet">

    <li><b>Advanced Communications Data Streaming</b>: A semester introduction to the theory of data exchange and implementations of communications systems.</li>

    <li><b>Advanced Communications Signal Processing</b>: A semester course focusing on applications of Digital Signal Processing with audio, video, and images.</li>

    <li><b>Advanced Prototyping Processes</b>: A semester introduction to processes in manufacturing, production, and systems engineering.</li>

    <li><b>Architectural Drawing and Design</b>: A semester course allowing students to explore architecture and create architectural drawings.</li>

    <li><b>Conventional Energy Systems (Energy Systems 1)</b>: A semester focusing on topics such as the history of energy sources and current energy systems and implementations.</li>

    <li><b>Alternative Energy Systems (Energy Systems 2)</b>: A semester study of topics of alternative energy, including thermodynamic systems, power sources for combustion engines, fuel cell processes, and other developing technologies.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Senior Technical Research Labratories</h3>

<p>In their senior year at TJ, students are required to take a Senior Technical Research Laboratory class. There are 14 different labs that students may choose from, although all of the labs have prerequisite courses that must be taken in earlier years.</p>

<p>The Senior Technical Research Labs are:</p>

    <li class="highlight-right">Automation &amp; Robotics</li>
    <li>Biotechnology &amp; Life Sciences</li>
    <li>Chemical Analysis &amp; Nanochemistry</li>
    <li>Engineering Design (formerly Computer Aided Design)</li>
    <li>Computer Systems</li>
    <li>Energy Systems</li>

</ul>

<p>Each lab is specially equipped with tools to aid students on their longterm year-log Senior Research Projects on a topic of their choice. As an alternative to the Senior Research Porject, a student can apply for mentorship where they leave school early to work under a school-approved mentor on research projects in operational labratories.</p>

<h3>Thomas Jefferson Symposium to Advance Research (tjSTAR)</h3>

<figure float="left" style="width: 250px">
    <img src="/tsa/images/school/tjstar-logo.png" width="250px" />
</figure>

<p>tjSTAR is an annual event that is hosted at Thomas Jefferson. The school day is divided into 7 sessions where students do a combination of watch other student presentations, present their own projects, view demonstrations, listen to guest presenters and student panels, or participate in design challenges. Many guests including organizations like the CIA and companies like Northrop Grumman, Lockeed Martin, and Ratheon come to demo their new technologies to students.</p>

<p>Freshmen present their IBET projects to a small classroom-sized audience, as do the Seniors with their Senior Research Projects. Any student may present a personal project after approval. The event is student run with administration support, and a tjSTAR committee meets as an extracurricular activity throughout the year to plan the event.</p>
